=head1 Welcome to perl101.org

Thanks for visiting perl101.org.  We hope to provide you with
everything that every Perl programmer should know.

Our goal is not to cover everything in Perl, or make you an expert.
What we've found, though, is that many Perl programmers don't know
what they don't know.  Perl101.org hopes to change that.

=head1 Where to get Perl

=head2 Do you have Perl?

Try typing "perl -v" at the command line.  You should get a version
statement.

    $ perl -v

    This is perl, v5.8.6 built for darwin-thread-multi-2level
    (with 3 registered patches, see perl -V for more detail)
    ....

=head2 Perl source

L<http://www.cpan.org/src>

You will need a compiler, a shell, and some system libraries.  Perl's
C<Configure> script will tell you if you're missing something.

If you're on Windows, you may not have a compiler to use.  Look
onward to Vanilla, Strawberry and ActiveState.

=head2 Windows Perl: Vanilla/Strawberry

L<http://www.vanillaperl.com>

Vanilla and Strawberry Perl are two Windows Perl distributions that
come with a compiler and enough of an environment to get Perl compiling
and running on that platform.

Unless you have a very specific need, you want the Strawberry Perl
distribution.

=head2 Windows Perl: ActiveState

Originators of Perl on Windows, and still very much involved in the
community, ActiveState releases their own version of Perl with a
module installation system called PPM.  If you don't want to deal with
the "hassle" of managing your Perl install yourself, this may be for you.
